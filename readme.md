Contents:

1.  Full source code, separated into files and folders, found in **/src**
2.  Single file, compiled source code, found in **/dist/room-bundle.js**
3.  Single file, old Season 13 HFL bot, by I'llhaveanother (@anarcer) found in **/dist/hfl-13.js**

# ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

You can use the code in two ways

1.  Copy the **room-bundle.js** file found in **/dist** and paste it in the console on https://www.haxball.com/headless
2.  Use the built in RoomLoader class to load the room using puppeteer.

### Using Haxball Headless

1. Go to https://www.haxball.com/headless
2. Right Click => Inspect Element
3. Go to to the tab labeled "console"
4. Select "top" from the dropdown
5. Paste the code, and press enter

**How do I change the name of the room, make it private, add a password, change max players?**
Do CTRL + F and search for "HAXFOOTBALL" which is the name of the room, and then you can change it to whatever you would like. Additionally, below you will find variables like maxPlayers, or password which you can edit to your liking.

### Using Puppeteer RoomLoader

Webpack will create two bundles, one for the room, and one for index.ts to actually load the rooms using puppeteer.

If you decide to use the Puppeteer RoomLoader, you **must** skip the reCAPCTHA by setting the token in **HBClientConfig** in the **room.config.ts** file. You can receive a token by visiting this [link](https://www.haxball.com/headlesstoken) where a token will be generated after solving the captcha. This token is only valid for an hour or two. Failing to provide a valid token in the **HBClientConfig** will prevent the room from loading, and Puppeteer will timeout and close.

1. Set the token in room.config.ts to skip the reCAPCTHA

```js
const roomConfig: HBClientConfig = {
  roomName: "üèà HAXFOOTBALL üèà",
  //...
  token: "thr1.AAAAAGMSZwGFVjuVLpD-ng.N4LFrFAnou8",
};
```

2. Next run the **build** command so you can build both bundles.

   npm run build

3. Configure changes in **/server/index.ts** to your liking, i.e headless mode and auto join

4. Run the **start** command to load the room.

   npm run start

# üîß Debugging

Set **DEBUG_MODE** to true in **room.config.ts** to show state and stat changes in the haxball chat.

```js
// For testing purposes
export const DEBUG_MODE: boolean = true;
```

# üõ†Ô∏èFeatures

Alongside the standard Haxfootball rules and gameplay are additional features to enhance the room.
